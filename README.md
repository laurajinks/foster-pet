<br/>

* Once a user is a member of one or more organizations, they can see a list of all animals in need of fostering from all of their organizations, and request to foster individual animals. The organization must then approve the request, and finally the user must accept

* As an organization, a user's dashboard shows a list of all current animals in the organization, as well as the number of pending applications. The organization can also create a custom application for potential members to fill out.
